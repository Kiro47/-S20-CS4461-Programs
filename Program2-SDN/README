Notes:
    - The ADD command, was assumed to be adding another existing route.
      Considering the implications it was assumed no new hosts could be added
    - If you don't think there is enough logging for a specific application, all
      of the applications include a "--debug" flag with significantly more info.
Known Bugs:
    - There's a possible race condition that can happen if two or more switches
      attempt to update their tables in the same instant.  The solution to
      getting around this would involve building a thread pool with a job
      queue and would take a few hours just to figure out how to do, so
      it was ignored for the scope of this program.
    - Apparently, sometimes the DELETE command duplicates data?  I have no
      idea where this is happening at.
