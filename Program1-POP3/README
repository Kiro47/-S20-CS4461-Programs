Notes:
    - In test email 3, there's a potential field "Hidden recipients", which
      I can't find any relevant to being a valid field.  The closest field I
      can find is "Undiclosed Recipients", so I can only assume to parse it as
      part of the CC list.
    - Assignment says "DETE" not "DELE" mostly positive that's a
      typo as RFC defines "DELE"
    - The assignment says 6 commands are defined,
      but only 5 are listed, so only 5 were implemented.
Known Bugs:
    - Deleting a message and attempting to redelete it will hang and error.
      This is due to the Mail_Repo's cache and whatnot.  Not enough time to fix
      it.  Somehow forgot that it wouldn't be deleted due to object copying
      instead of referencing.
